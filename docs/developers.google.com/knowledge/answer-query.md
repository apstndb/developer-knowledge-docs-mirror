description: The Developer Knowledge API and MCP server provide access to Google's developer knowledge.
data_source: developers.google.com
---

The Developer Knowledge API lets you ask questions about Google developer products and receive direct, natural-language answers. For each query, the API composes a response drawn from the [Developer Knowledge corpus](https://developers.google.com/knowledge/reference/corpus-reference) (referred to in the API reference as *grounded generation* ) and includes citations to the relevant documentation pages.

## Before you begin

Set up your environment for your preferred tool:

### gcloud

[Install and configure the gcloud CLI, and enable the Developer Knowledge API](https://developers.google.com/knowledge/quickstart-gcloud#before-you-begin) .

### REST

[Enable the API and generate a Developer Knowledge API key](https://developers.google.com/knowledge/quickstart#before-you-begin) . Then, save your key to an environment variable:

    export DEVELOPERKNOWLEDGE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"

Replace `  YOUR_API_KEY  ` with your Developer Knowledge API key.

## Answer a query

Use the [`gcloud developer-knowledge answer-query` command](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/developer-knowledge/answer-query) or the [`answerQuery`](https://developers.google.com/knowledge/reference/rest/v1/TopLevel/answerQuery) REST method to ask a question.

The following example sends a query asking how to create a BigQuery dataset:

### gcloud

    gcloud developer-knowledge answer-query \
      --query="How do I create a BigQuery dataset?"

### REST

    curl -X POST "https://developerknowledge.googleapis.com/v1:answerQuery?key=$DEVELOPERKNOWLEDGE_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"query": "How do I create a BigQuery dataset?"}'

The response contains the text answer in the `answer.answerText` field, along with `citations` and `references` in the [`answer`](https://developers.google.com/knowledge/reference/rest/v1/TopLevel/answerQuery#answer) object:

    {
      "answer": {
        "answerText": "To create a BigQuery dataset, you can use the Google Cloud Console, the bq command-line tool, or the BigQuery client libraries.",
        "citations": [
          {
            "startIndex": 0,
            "endIndex": 123,
            "sources": [
              {
                "referenceIndex": 0
              }
            ]
          }
        ],
        "references": [
          {
            "documentReference": {
              "documentChunk": {
                "parent": "documents/docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/datasets",
                "content": "This page explains how to create BigQuery datasets...",
                "document": {
                  "name": "documents/docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/datasets",
                  "title": "Introduction to datasets",
                  "uri": "https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/datasets"
                }
              }
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }

## Filter documentation sources

To restrict the documentation sources used to generate the answer, pass a filter expression using the `--query-filter` flag in the gcloud CLI or the `filter` field in your REST request body. For details on supported filter fields and operators, see [Filter search results](https://developers.google.com/knowledge/howto#filter-results) .

The following example restricts the documentation sources to `docs.cloud.google.com` :

### gcloud

    gcloud developer-knowledge answer-query \
      --query="How do I create a BigQuery dataset?" \
      --query-filter='data_source = "docs.cloud.google.com"'

### REST

    curl -X POST "https://developerknowledge.googleapis.com/v1:answerQuery?key=$DEVELOPERKNOWLEDGE_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "query": "How do I create a BigQuery dataset?",
        "filter": "data_source = \"docs.cloud.google.com\""
      }'

## Choose between `AnswerQuery` and `SearchDocumentChunks`

When you're using the API or the Developer Knowledge MCP server, choose the method that best fits what you're looking for:

  - **`AnswerQuery` (or the `answer_query` MCP tool)** : best for general "how-to" questions, comparing products, and step-by-step guides where you want a complete summary with links to the source docs.
  - **`SearchDocumentChunks` (or the `search_documents` MCP tool)** : best for looking up exact CLI flags, code syntax, parameter names, or IAM permissions (such as `service.resource.verb` ). Use two to five specific keywords instead of a full question.

> **Tip:** Install the [`retrieving-developer-knowledge`](https://developers.google.com/knowledge/mcp#agent-skill) agent skill in your AI coding assistant so it automatically picks the right tool for your question.
